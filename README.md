# Audio Splitting and Transcription Tool

This project provides a simple and automated workflow to split a long audio file into multiple parts, transcribe each part into text using OpenAI Whisper, and save the results as Word (.docx) documents. It is designed for use in Google Colab, making it easy to process large audio files without local setup.

## Features

- **Audio Splitting:** Automatically splits your audio file into 15-minute segments (with the last segment for any remaining duration).
- **Transcription:** Transcribes each audio part to text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- **Document Generation:** Creates a separate Word document for each transcript and a combined document for all parts.
- **Easy Downloads:** Download your processed files directly from the Colab environment.

## Requirements

- Google Colab
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install automatically in the notebook):
  - `whisper`
  - `python-docx`
  - `google-generativeai`

## How It Works

1. **Audio File Setup:**  
   Upload your audio file to the Colab environment and specify its filename in the script (`input_file`).

2. **Splitting:**  
   The script splits the audio into four parts: the first three are each 15 minutes, and the last contains the remaining audio.

3. **Conversion:**  
   Each audio part is converted to WAV format for compatibility with Whisper.

4. **Transcription:**  
   Whisper transcribes each segment, saving both individual and combined transcripts as `.docx` files.

5. **Download:**  
   Download the resulting audio and transcript files to your local computer.

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook:**  
   Use [this Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eldIAns03PKxLb_KYZj7C8utKCi0aMmf) or upload the script to your own Colab.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   The script will automatically install all required packages.

3. **Upload and Set Filename:**  
   Upload your `.mp4` audio file to Colab and set the `input_file` variable.

4. **Run the Script:**  
   Execute each cell in order. The script will split, convert, transcribe, and generate your files.

5. **Download Results:**  
   Use the generated download links to get your `.wav` and `.docx` files.

## Example

```python
# Set your file name
input_file = "your_audio_file.mp4"
```

## Output

- `output_part1.wav`, `output_part2.wav`, `output_part3.wav`, `output_part4.wav`  
  (Split audio files)
- `output_part1_transcript.docx`, ..., `output_part4_transcript.docx`  
  (Transcripts for each part)
- `combined_transcript.docx`  
  (Single document with all transcripts)
